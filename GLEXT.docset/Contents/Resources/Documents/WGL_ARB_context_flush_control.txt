Number

    ARB Extension #168
    OpenGL ES Extension #191 (for GL_KHR_context_flush_control only) 

Dependencies

    GL_KHR_context_flush_control is written against the OpenGL 4.4 (Core
    Profile) specification, but can be implemented against any version of
    OpenGL or OpenGL ES.

    GL_KHR_context_flush_control is written against the OpenGL 4.4 (Core
    Profile) specification.

    GLX_ARB_context_flush_control is written against the GLX 1.4 and
    GLX_ARB_create_context specifications. Both are required.

    WGL_ARB_context_flush_control is written against the
    WGL_ARB_create_context specification, which is required.

Overview

    OpenGL and OpenGL ES have long supported multiple contexts. The
    semantics of switching contexts is generally left to window system
    binding APIs such as WGL, GLX and EGL. Most of these APIs (if not all)
    specify that when the current context for a thread is changed, the
    outgoing context performs an implicit flush of any commands that have
    been issued to that point. OpenGL and OpenGL ES define a flush as
    sending any pending commands for execution and that this action will
    result in their completion in finite time.

    This behavior has subtle consequences. For example, if an application is
    rendering to the front buffer and switches contexts, it may assume that
    any rendering performed thus far will eventually be visible to the user.
    With recent introduction of shared memory buffers, there become inumerable
    ways in which applications may observe side effects of an implicit flush
    (or lack thereof).

    In general, a full flush is not the desired behavior of the application.
    Nonetheless, applications that switch contexts frequently suffer the
    performance consequences of this unless implementations make special
    considerations for them, which is generally untenable.

    The WGL and GLX extensions add new context creation parameters the allow
    an application to specify the behavior that is desired when a context is
    made non-current, and specifically to opt out of the implicit flush
    behavior. The GL extension allows querying the context flush behavior.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens (GL)

    NOTE: when implemented in an OpenGL ES context, all tokens defined by
    this extension must have a "_KHR" suffix. When implemented in an OpenGL
    context, all tokens must have NO suffix, as described below.

    Accepted by the <pname> parameter of GetIntegerv, GetFloatv, GetBooleanv
    GetDoublev and GetInteger64v:

        GL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR                         0x82FB

    Returned in <data> by GetIntegerv, GetFloatv, GetBooleanv
    GetDoublev and GetInteger64v when <pname> is
    GL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR:

        GL_NONE                                             0x0000
        GL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH                   0x82FC

New Tokens (WGL)

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <*attrib_list> argument to
    wglCreateContextAttribsARB:

        WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_ARB                    0x2097

    Accepted as an attribute value for
    WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_BEHAVIOR_ARB in the <*attrib_list> argument
    to wglCreateContextAttribsARB:

        WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE_ARB               0x0000
        WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB              0x2098

New Tokens (GLX)

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <*attrib_list> argument to
    glXCreateContextAttribsARB:

        GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_ARB                    0x2097

    Accepted as an attribute value for
    GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_BEHAVIOR_ARB in the <*attrib_list> argument
    to glXCreateContextAttribsARB:

        GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE_ARB               0x0000
        GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB              0x2098

Additions to Chapter 22 of the OpenGL 4.4 Core Pofile Specification (Context
State Queries)

    In Subsection 22.2, "String Queries", after the description of
    CONTEXT_FLAGS, insert the following:

    The behavior of the context when it is made no longer current (released)
    by the platform binding may be queried by calling GetIntegerv with
    <value> CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR. If the behavior is
    CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH, any pending commands on the context will
    be flushed. If the behavior is NONE, pending commands are not flushed.

    The default value is CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH, and may in some
    cases be changed using platform-specific context creation extensions.

Additions to WGL_ARB_create_context and wglMakeCurrent

    Add a new paragraph to the description of wglCreateContextAttribsARB, as
    defined by WGL_ARB_create_context:

    "The attribute name WGL_MAKE_NON_CONTEXT_BEHAVIOR_ARB specifies the
    behavior of the rendering context when it is made non-current. The
    attribute value may be one of WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB or
    WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE_ARB. The default value of
    WGL_MAKE_NON_CONTEXT_BEHAVIOR_ARB is
    WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB."

    Define flushing behavior for wglMakeCurrent (there is no WGL
    specification; this language replaces the sentence "Before switching to
    the new rendering context, OpenGL flushes any previous rendering context
    that was current to the calling thread." in the Microsoft wglMakeCurrent
    reference page):

    "If the calling thread already has a current rendering context, behavior
    is determined by the <release behavior> (the value of the
    WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_ARB parameter) of the current context. If
    the release behavior is WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB, pending
    commands to the previous context are flushed; if the release behavior is
    WGL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE_ARB, then no action is taken, and it
    as if the application simply stops making GL commands on that context.
    That context is marked as no longer current, and <ctx> is mde the
    current context for the calling thread."

Additions to the GLX 1.4 Specification and GLX_ARB_create_context

    Add a new paragraph to the description of glXCreateContextAttribsARB,
    as defined by GLX_ARB_create_context:

    "The attribute name GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_ARB specifies the
    behavior of the rendering context when it is made non-current. The
    attribute value may be one of GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB or
    GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE_ARB. The default value of
    GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_ARB is GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB."

    Modify section 3.3.7 "Rendering Contexts" on p. 27: 

    Replace the third paragraph in the description of glXMakeContextCurrent,
    starting "If the calling thread already has a current rendering
    context...":

    "If the calling thread already has a current rendering context, behavior
    is determined by the <release behavior> (the value of the
    GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_ARB parameter) of the current context. If
    the release behavior is GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_FLUSH_ARB, pending
    commands to the previous context are flushed; if the release behavior is
    GLX_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE_ARB, then no action is taken, and it
    as if the application simply stops making GL commands on that context.
    That context is marked as no longer current, and <ctx> is mde the
    current context for the calling thread."


GLX Protocol

    TBD.

Errors

    The errors defined for glXCreateContextAttribsARB and
    wglCreateContextAttribsARB already describe the situations where invalid
    attribute values for the context release behavior are specified, and
    where no context can be created satisfying the specified behavior, so no
    new errors need be added here.

New State

    None.

New Implementation Dependent State

Usage Examples

    TBD

Issues

    1) What happens when you switch between contexts that have the new
       {WGL/GLX}_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR_NONE_ARB behavior?

       Nothing. It is as if the thread simply stopped calling functions on
       one context and started calling functions on another. If, for
       example, an application is rendering to multiple windows or multiple
       framebuffer objects, it may not care what order commands are executed
       across the contexts. This extension allows the application to rapidly
       switch between contexts that may or may not share objects without any
       implied flushes.

    2) Does this extension affect or change sharing semantics?

       RESOLVED: No. There is no intention to do so. From the client's
       perspective, at least, changes made to objects on one context should
       be visible to other contexts whenever they would have before.
       However, there may be some subtle interaction here that we haven't
       thought of yet.

    3) Do we need to be able to query the context behavior?

       RESOLVED. Yes. Added a state query for GL_CONTEXT_RELEASE_BEHAVIOR.

    4) Should WGL / GLX / GL enum values for similar tokens be shared?

       RESOLVED: the developing tradition is for window system binding enums
       for context creation to share the same values, but GL to have its own
       values lying in the traditional GL enum ranges.

    5) Should there be a GL extension string corresponding to 
       the window system binding extension strings?

       RESOLVED: Yes. This is how we've always done it. Added
       GL_KHR_context_flush_control to Name Strings in revision 3.

    6) Should there be an EGL equivalent of this functionality? Should the
       GL extension be KHR or ARB?

       RESOLVED: Yes, there should be an EGL extension, but it will be
       approved on a different schedule by EGL and GL WGs. The GL extension
       should be KHR, since ES is also interested in this functionality.

    7) When the release behavior of an OpenGL compatibility profile context
       or an OpenGL ES 1.x context is to not flush, should it be possible to
       make a context non-current within a glBegin/glEnd pair?

       RESOLVED: No. Only GLX (not EGL or WGL) specifies this constraint,
       and hypothetical immediate-mode paths would have difficulty
       supporting MakeCurrent between Begin and End whether or not a flush
       is done.
